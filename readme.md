# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

Alan's fork

To do: 
1. Move F keys to their own layer with available modifiers. one-shot layer triggered by a combo.
2. Add a gaming layer for the future (wasd etc.). toggle and detoggle layer with fat combo (maybe QWERTY W,A,D,Space)

1. Find better Super key solution to work with wayland (or maybe make shortcuts not use super key)                          --> use GUI ALT CTRL mod on left outer pinky, giving the option to shift for app launches
2. Find better Delete key solution that doesn't force you to move the right hand (maybe just r+h instead of h+bckspc)       --> done
3. Add fastscroll to nav layer (5x Arrow up / down or something like that)                                                  --> done
4. Switch to swiss layout (no dead keys)                                                                                    --> to do
5. Mayyyyybbeeee rethink the Numbers (numpad), or make numpad more accessible                                               --> still a maybe
