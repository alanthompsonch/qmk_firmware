# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

Alan's fork

To do: 
1. Move F keys to their own layer with available modifiers. one-shot layer triggered by a combo.
2. Add a gaming layer for the future (wasd etc.). toggle and detoggle layer with fat combo (maybe all thumb keys)
3. Find better Delete key solution (r+h doesn't feel great)
4. fix colon on num layer for swiss keyboard
5. Mayyyyybbeeee rethink the Numbers (numpad), or make numpad more accessible                                               --> still a maybe
