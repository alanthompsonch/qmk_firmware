# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

Alan's fork

To do: 
1. Find better Super key solution to work with wayland (or maybe make shortcuts not use super key)
2. Find better Delete key solution that doesn't force you to move the right hand (maybe just r+h instead of h+bckspc)
3. Add fastscroll to nav layer (5x Arrow up / down or something like that)
4. Switch to swiss layout (no dead keys)
5. Mayyyyybbeeee rethink the Numbers (numpad)
